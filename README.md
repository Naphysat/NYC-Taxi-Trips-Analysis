New York has two varieties of taxi cabs – yellow and green. They pick up street-hailing and prearranged passengers anywhere in New York City. The Yellow taxis (Medallions) are the most common and are able to pick up passengers anywhere in the five boroughs. However, the green taxis (boro taxis) were made available in August 2013 to balance taxi presence around the city and are only allowed to pick up passengers in outer boroughs.

In this project, I assumed the role of a data analyst for a Lead Dispatcher for NYC Green Taxis. She requested that she’s only concerned about trips that were not sent via ‘store and forward’ and street-hailed trips paid by credit or cash, with a standard rate from 2017-2020 only.
Therefore, the dataset of 28,000,000 rows were filtered and analyzed based on the above demands.

QUESTIONS

What's the average number of trips? 
What's the average fare per trip we expect to collect? 
What's the average distance traveled per trip? 
How do we expect trip volume to change, relative to last week? 
Which days of the week and times of the day will be busiest? 
What will likely be the most popular pick-up and drop-off locations

KPIs

Total Trips amounted to 26,290,715
Total Passengers- 35,513,263
Revenue generated- $389,616,641
Average Trip Fare- $12.31
Average Trip Distance- 2.838

From the analysis, highest revenue was generated in 2017 and significant reduction was seen year on year. We can attribute this to the high trip volume which was recorded in 2017 compared to subsequent years.

The preferred mode of payment by passengers is credit card with 54.19%

Also, the busiest day of the week is Saturday. Following closely is Friday and Thursday.  This could be because people go out when its weekend compared to weekdays as there was low trip recorded on Mondays as seen in the report. The busiest time is also Evening and may be due to the fact that people close from business around this time.

The most popular Borough is Manhattan majorly because it is most densely populated among the five boroughs and also its thriving nature.

Manhattan East Harlem North is the most popular pick up and drop off location.
